# Game Boy Clock Accuracy Challenge

## About

The Game Boy Clock Accuracy Challenge is about determining real clock speeds of Game Boys.

## Background

The Game Boy CPU is specified to run at 4194304 Hz.
(Super Game Boy: 4295454 Hz.)
While these numbers seem very exact, they are known to be inaccurate.
A real Game Boy will run faster or slower.
This project measures how fast or slow.
The results are compiled to a database, which may be used as reference.

## Participate

 1. Find an accurate timer (e.g. smartwatch, smartphone).
 2. Install gbchrono.gb on a Game Boy flash cartridge.
 3. Start your Game Boy. gbchrono.gb will beep to show that is it ready. Prepare your timer.
 4. Simultaneously start timer and tap A on Game Boy. The measurement starts when the button is released.
 5. Let your Game Boy run for a long time. Maybe overnight?
 6. Simultaneously stop timer and tap A on Game Boy. The measurement stops when the button is released.
 7. The Game Boy will now show some digits that tell the elapsed time.
 8. Enter the data on the Google Sheet.

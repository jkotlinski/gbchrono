# Game Boy Clock Challenge

## About

The Game Boy Clock Challenge is about determining real clock speeds of Game Boys.

## Background

The Game Boy CPU is specified to run at 4194304 Hz.
(Super Game Boy: 4295454 Hz).
While these numbers seem very exact, they are known to be inaccurate.
A real Game Boy will run faster or slower.
This project measures how fast or slow.
The results are compiled to a database, which may be used as reference.

## Participate

 1. Find a reasonably accurate timer (e.g. smartwatch, smartphone).
 2. Install gbchrono.gb on a Game Boy flash cartridge.
 3. Start your Game Boy. gbchrono.gb will beep to show that is it ready. Ready your timer.
 4. With a quick tap, simultaneously start timer and press A on Game Boy. The beep will stop.
 5. Let your Game Boy run overnight.
 6. With a quick tap, simultaneously stop timer and press A on Game Boy.
 7. The Game Boy will now show some digits that tell the elapsed time.
 8. Enter the data on the Google Sheet.
